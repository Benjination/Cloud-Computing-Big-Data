• Part 2:
Task: You are will create a cloud-based picture and associated information
storage and retrieval system with a (local) web interface (UI)
Description:
One of the most common uses of “Clouds”, is shared or backup storage.
SaaS, with a friendly interface.
Your assignment is to provide a local interface to a cloud service
that you will implement that will allow a user to upload a
meta-information table “people.csv”, a .csv (text) table followed by
several individual pictures. Then the user may do queries that select
some (or none) pictures, specified in the people table.

And your cloud-based “service” will allow a user to:
+ Search for Tanzima (Name) and show her picture on a web page.
+ Search for (display) all pictures where the salary is
less than 99000.
+ Add a picture for Dave
+ Remove Dave
+ Change Tuan’s keywords to “Not so nice anymore”
+ Change Someone’s salary
And similar…

And your cloud-based “service” will allow a user to:
• (Obviously) Enter a name or an amount where needed (may not
search for Tuan, maybe Tanzima)
• Or some method (your choice) to execute commands such as remove
a person, change a picture, and similar

Part 3: (Implementation)
• You may use any reasonable (non-hardcoded) implementation of the
people table, for example: a hash, a SQL (or no-SQL) table, or even a
dictionary or array
• Pictures are binary entities stored on the cloud provider storage, in
any manner you wish (files, DB tables, hashes, etc)
• You should handle conditions such as: missing data (fields, attributes),
unavailable pictures, attempts to upload the same named picture
twice, pictures that are of incorrect type (“dave.txt”), and similar
