# 🛡️ Firebase Security for Quiz Project

## Important Security Notes

### ✅ Firebase API Keys Are Public by Design
- Firebase API keys are **meant to be public** and appear in every web/mobile app
- They identify your project, but don't grant access by themselves
- Real security comes from **Firestore Security Rules**, not hiding API keys

### 🔒 Actual Security Measures

#### 1. Firestore Security Rules (CRITICAL)
The current rules are in "test mode" which allows all reads/writes. For production:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Only allow reads, no writes from public
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if false;
    }
    
    // Or for quiz environment, allow writes for limited time
    match /quiz_data/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.time < timestamp.date(2025, 12, 31);
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Domain Restrictions
In Firebase Console > Authentication > Settings > Authorized domains:
- Add only: `benjination.github.io`
- Remove: `localhost` (after development)

#### 3. API Key Restrictions  
In Google Cloud Console > Credentials:
- Restrict API key to specific websites
- Add HTTP referrers: `benjination.github.io/*`

### 🎯 For Your Quiz (Recommended Approach)

1. **Keep the current setup** - Firebase API keys are public by design
2. **Focus on security rules** - This is where real protection happens
3. **Set time-based restrictions** - Allow quiz access only during exam period
4. **Monitor usage** - Firebase console shows all database activity

### 🚨 If You're Still Concerned

If you want to be extra cautious, you can:

1. **Create a new Firebase project** just for the quiz
2. **Regenerate API keys** after the quiz
3. **Use different projects** for development vs quiz day

### 📊 Current Security Status

- ✅ Project created: `realquiz2-a1d06`
- ⚠️ Security rules: Test mode (30 days)
- ⚠️ Domain restrictions: Not set
- ⚠️ API key restrictions: Not set

### 🔧 Quick Security Setup

1. **Set Production Security Rules:**
   ```
   Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/realquiz2-a1d06/firestore/rules
   ```

2. **Restrict Domains:**
   ```
   Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/realquiz2-a1d06/authentication/settings
   ```

3. **API Key Restrictions:**
   ```
   Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
   ```

### 💡 Bottom Line

For a quiz environment, the current setup is actually fine. Firebase is designed for public API keys. Focus your security efforts on:
1. Proper security rules
2. Domain restrictions  
3. Time-limited access
4. Monitoring

The API keys being visible is normal and expected for Firebase web apps.
