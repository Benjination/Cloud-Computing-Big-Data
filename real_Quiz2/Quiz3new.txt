 1.  I understand that I am on my honor during this quiz, I will not collaborate, use 
     non-allowed sources, and I will not discuss or share this quiz with anyone for the next 
     12 hours.
     You MAY: use Google to search, use previous source code, 
     YOU MAY NOT use:

     This is a timed test. Late tests will have points deducted for being late.
     Very late tests will not be graded.

     When you are complete, with any part, please show or send the link, raise your hand, so we may visually inspect that part.

     The second part of the test, you should electronically submit, you will need to copy and paste 
     only those lines of code to implement that part of the test, usually a few (two to eight) lines of code. 
     Place it immediately after the question.

     Submit this Quiz (renamed) with code cut and pasted, ONLY text. DO NOT submit zips, binaries, libraries,
     or anything other than text.

     When any parts(questions) are complete complete, submit this test, you may make multiple submissions.

     If you have computer, or other, problems, please raise your hand immediately.

 2. Get files from this same folder.
   
 3. Name your program/submission with your name and last digits of your ID.

 4. Using the cloud services provider, all functionality possible should be implemented on that provider.
    (Of course, displaying web pages through a browser and the user interface is "local")
    The cloud provider is MS Azure.

 5. Upload all data files (*jpg and *csv, not this quiz) to the cloud service.

 6. Please create a relational database (your choice which) from the .csv data on the cloud provider, you may do this manually 
    or in code, it is your choice.
  
Show and submit code, when each part is complete, raise your hand and then show us:
 
 10. (a) Allow a user to give a range of time values (for example 18020 to 18060) and you will show the ID, the net value, 
         the time, the id, and the latitude and longitude values for all in within that range.
         Also - please show the time to do those queries. 

     **TA TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR 10(a):**
     1. Navigate to section "4. üìÖ Time Range Search (Quiz 3 Req 10a)"
     2. Enter Start Time: 15000
     3. Enter End Time: 16000
     4. Click "üîç Search Time Range"
     5. Verify results show: ID, net value, time, latitude, longitude for all records in range
     6. Verify execution time is prominently displayed in green performance box
     7. Test caching: Run same search again and note faster execution time with "(Cached)" label

     (b) Allow a user to give a time (for example 15560) and a net value (for example "ak") and a count C (for example 3)
         and you will show all C events at that net value starting at that time (for this example at time 15560, 15820,
         15840 at net value "ak" show those 3 events with the same attributes as part a)
         Also - please show the time to do those queries.

     **TA TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR 10(b):**
     1. Navigate to section "5. üîó Time + Net + Count Search (Quiz 3 Req 10b)"
     2. Enter Starting Time: 15560
     3. Enter Net Value: ak
     4. Enter Count (C): 3
     5. Click "üîç Search Sequential Events"
     6. Verify results show exactly 3 sequential events at net "ak" starting from time 15560
     7. Verify same attributes as 10(a): ID, net, time, latitude, longitude
     8. Verify execution time displayed in cyan performance box
     9. Test with different net values: "us", "ci", "nn" 

 11. A user will give you the number of times (T) to do the "query", you will do both of the previous questions 
     that number (T) of times (that is repeat the query T times) and show the results as well as the the individual 
     times for each followed by the total time taken. (slight modification to 10.)

     **TA TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR 11:**
     1. Navigate to section "6. üîÑ Repeated Query Performance Testing (Quiz 3 Req 11)"
     2. Set Number of Repetitions (T): 5
     3. Verify test parameters are set:
        - Time Range: Start Time: 15000, End Time: 16000
        - Time+Net+Count: Starting Time: 15500, Net Value: us, Count: 3
     4. Click "üöÄ Run T Repetition Tests"
     5. Verify results show:
        - Overall summary with total execution time
        - Individual iteration results for both query types
        - Cache performance statistics (hits/misses/hit rate)
        - Detailed table showing each of the 5 repetitions with execution times
        - Cache hit indicators (‚úÖ for cache hit, ‚ùå for Firebase query)
     6. Note: First iteration should be slower (Firebase), subsequent iterations faster (cache hits)

 12. The user will give a time (if it exists) and modify any of the attributes.

     **TA TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR 12:**
     1. Scroll down to "Update Earthquake Record Service" section
     2. Enter a time value that exists in database: 15000
     3. Click "üîç Find Record by Time"
     4. Verify existing record details are displayed
     5. Modify any attribute (e.g., change magnitude from 2.1 to 2.5)
     6. Click "üíæ Update Record"
     7. Verify success message and updated details are shown
     8. Optionally: Re-search for same time to confirm changes persisted in Firebase

 13. Repeat the previous question 10 and 11 using (in addition to the database) an in-memory caching mechanism 
     (NOT an in-memory database) then show us. 
     Please show us the number of cache hits and cache misses and times.

     **TA TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR 13:**
     CACHING IS INTEGRATED INTO ALL SEARCHES - DEMONSTRATE AS FOLLOWS:
     
     A. Cache Performance in Individual Searches:
        1. Perform any search from 10(a) or 10(b) - note execution time
        2. Repeat EXACT same search - note much faster time and "(Cached)" label
        3. Wait 5+ minutes OR click "üßπ Clear Cache" button to reset
        4. Repeat search - note slower time as cache was cleared
     
     B. Cache Statistics in Repeated Testing (Requirement 11):
        1. Run the repeated query test from requirement 11
        2. Observe detailed cache statistics:
           - Cache Hit Rate percentage
           - Individual iteration cache hit indicators (‚úÖ/‚ùå)
           - First iteration: Cache miss (slower, Firebase query)
           - Subsequent iterations: Cache hits (faster, memory retrieval)
        3. Console logs show cache operations for technical verification
     
     C. Cache Management:
        1. Scroll to "üßπ Cache Controls" section
        2. Click "üßπ Clear Cache" to demonstrate cache clearing functionality
        3. Verify all subsequent searches hit Firebase until cache repopulates

 14. Show us, in a link, the application running and we will try it out. Only for parts 10,11,12,13,

     **TA TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR 14:**

     2. Repeat same search to show caching effect (faster time, "Cached" label)
     3. Test Time+Net+Count Search (10b) with different parameters  
     4. Run Repeated Query Test (11) to show comprehensive performance analysis
     5. Update a record (12) to show modification capability
