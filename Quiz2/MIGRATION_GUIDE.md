# Complete Migration Guide: Azure SQL + Flask → Firebase + GitHub Pages

## 🎯 **Migration Overview**

You're migrating from a paid Azure solution to a **completely free** hosting solution:

**Before (Azure - Costs Money):**
- Azure App Service (Flask hosting)
- Azure SQL Database
- Ongoing monthly costs

**After (Free Forever):**
- GitHub Pages (Static hosting)
- Firebase Firestore (Free tier)
- Zero ongoing costs!

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Migration Process**

### **Step 1: Export Your Data from Azure SQL**

First, let's get your earthquake data out of Azure before it gets locked:

```bash
# Run the migration script to export your data
python migrate_to_firebase.py
```

This creates:
- `earthquakes_export.json` - Full data export for Firebase
- `earthquakes_export.csv` - Easy upload format for web interface
- `firebase_import_instructions.md` - Detailed import instructions

### **Step 2: Set Up Firebase (Free)**

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. **Create New Project**:
   - Click "Add project"
   - Name: "earthquake-analysis" (or your choice)
   - Disable Google Analytics (not needed)
   - Click "Create project"

3. **Enable Firestore Database**:
   - In left sidebar, click "Firestore Database"
   - Click "Create database"
   - Choose "Start in test mode" (allows read/write)
   - Select location closest to you
   - Click "Done"

4. **Get Firebase Configuration**:
   - In left sidebar, click "Project settings" (⚙️ icon)
   - Scroll down to "Your apps"
   - Click "Web" icon (</>)
   - App nickname: "earthquake-web-app"
   - Don't check "Firebase Hosting" (we're using GitHub Pages)
   - Click "Register app"
   - **Copy the firebaseConfig object** - you'll need this!

### **Step 3: Update Your HTML Files**

Replace the placeholder Firebase config in both `index.html` and `search.html`:

```javascript
// Replace this placeholder config:
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "your-api-key-here",
    authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "your-project-id",
    storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "123456789",
    appId: "your-app-id"
};

// With your actual Firebase config from Step 2
```

### **Step 4: Set Up GitHub Pages**

1. **Push Your Files to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   # If not already in git repository
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Migrate to Firebase + GitHub Pages"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/Benjination/Cloud-Computing-Big-Data.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Scroll down to "Pages" in left sidebar
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: "main" 
   - Folder: "/ (root)"
   - Click "Save"

3. **Your site will be available at**:
   `https://benjination.github.io/Cloud-Computing-Big-Data/`

### **Step 5: Upload Your Data to Firebase**

**Option A: Using Your Web Interface (Recommended)**
1. Open your GitHub Pages URL
2. Click "Upload Data" button  
3. Select `earthquakes_export.csv`
4. Click "Upload CSV to Firebase"
5. Wait for upload completion

**Option B: Using Firebase Console**
1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database
2. Click the import button
3. Upload `earthquakes_export.json`

### **Step 6: Configure Firestore Security Rules**

In Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true; // For development/academic use
    }
  }
}
```

Click "Publish" to save the rules.

## 🎉 **Your New Free Architecture**

### **File Structure for GitHub Pages:**
```
your-repo/
├── index.html          # Main dashboard (Firebase-powered)
├── search.html         # Search & analysis page
├── migrate_to_firebase.py  # Data export script
├── earthquakes_export.csv  # Your data for upload
├── README.md           # Project documentation
└── .env               # Keep for local development only
```

### **Features That Still Work:**
- ✅ All magnitude searches
- ✅ Geographic location searches  
- ✅ Day/night pattern analysis
- ✅ Weekend vs weekday analysis
- ✅ Early morning analysis
- ✅ Earthquake clustering
- ✅ Pagination system
- ✅ Professional UI
- ✅ Responsive design

### **New Benefits:**
- ✅ **100% Free hosting** (no more Azure costs!)
- ✅ **No server maintenance** required
- ✅ **Automatic scaling** with Firebase
- ✅ **Lightning fast** static site hosting
- ✅ **Built-in CDN** with GitHub Pages
- ✅ **Automatic backups** in git

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Firebase Connection Fails:**
1. Check that firebaseConfig is correctly set
2. Verify Firestore is enabled in Firebase Console
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Ensure security rules allow read/write

### **If GitHub Pages Doesn't Load:**
1. Check that repository is public
2. Verify Pages is enabled in repository settings
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for initial deployment
4. Check repository → Actions for build status

### **If Data Upload Fails:**
1. Check that CSV file is properly formatted
2. Verify Firebase connection is working
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try uploading smaller batches

## 📊 **Firebase Free Tier Limits**

Your earthquake analysis app will be well within the free limits:

- **Firestore**: 1 GB storage, 50,000 reads/day, 20,000 writes/day
- **GitHub Pages**: 100 GB bandwidth/month, 10 builds/hour
- **Cost**: **$0.00** forever (unless you exceed limits)

For a typical earthquake dataset with 30,000 records, you'll use:
- ~50 MB storage (well under 1 GB limit)
- ~1,000 reads/day for normal usage (well under 50K limit)

## 🎯 **Testing Your Migration**

1. **Open your GitHub Pages URL**
2. **Verify database connection** - should show record count
3. **Test magnitude search** - try searching magnitude > 5.0
4. **Test location search** - search near Tokyo (35.6762, 139.6503)  
5. **Test analysis features** - try day/night analysis
6. **Verify pagination** - check results display properly

## 📝 **For Your Assignment Documentation**

Update your assignment to mention the migration:

```
Due to Azure credit limitations, this application has been migrated to a
free hosting solution using Firebase Firestore and GitHub Pages. All 
original features remain functional with improved performance and zero
ongoing costs.

Live Demo: https://benjination.github.io/Cloud-Computing-Big-Data/
Technology Stack: Firebase Firestore, GitHub Pages, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps After Migration**

1. **Test all features** thoroughly
2. **Update your assignment documentation** 
3. **Create a backup** of your earthquake data
4. **Consider adding new features** (now that hosting is free!)
5. **Share your free solution** with classmates

Your earthquake analysis application is now running on a completely free, scalable, and professional hosting solution that will never expire or cost money! 🎉
