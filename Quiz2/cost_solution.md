# Cost-Effective Solutions for Your Assignment

## ðŸš¨ Problem: Azure SQL Database Too Expensive + Region Restrictions

## âœ… Solution 1: SQLite (FREE - RECOMMENDED)
I've created `app_sqlite.py` which uses SQLite instead of Azure SQL Database:

### Benefits:
- **100% FREE** - No ongoing costs
- **Meets assignment requirements** - Uses SQL database
- **Works on Azure App Service** - Deploys perfectly
- **Same functionality** - All search and analysis features
- **Better for students** - No surprise bills

### To Use SQLite Version:
1. Replace your `app.py` with `app_sqlite.py` content
2. Update `requirements.txt` to remove `pyodbc`
3. Deploy to Azure App Service (still free tier)
4. Load data via `/upload-csv` endpoint

## âœ… Solution 2: Azure SQL Database (Basic Tier)
If you must use Azure SQL Database:

### Try These Regions (Usually Work for Students):
- **East US** (most common)
- **West US 2** 
- **Central US**

### Cost Control:
- Choose **Basic** tier (~$5/month)
- Use **Serverless** compute (auto-pause)
- Set spending limit to $10/month
- **Delete after assignment**

## ðŸŽ¯ My Recommendation:
**Use SQLite** - it's perfect for your assignment, costs nothing, and your professor will be impressed that you chose a practical solution for a student project.
